	<h1> Post-Proposition 2: NYCâ€™s Mobile Food Vendor License Queue</h1>
	

		<h3> 62% of voters voted "yes" on Proposition 2 which would increase the authority of the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) to keep city property clean. Some advocates feel, this will be an attack on street vendors, many whom operate without a license because of the city's backlog. </h3>

<P> In the recent election, New Yorkers voted to pass Proposition 2, granting the Department of Sanitation of New York (DSNY) authority to ensure mobile food vendors comply with city rules and regulations. According to NYC Campaign Finance Board official Tim Hunter, many voted yes on the proposition because the wording made it seem like it would allow the DSNY the ability to regulate it's own schedule. "I don't think many people did deeper research to know the deeper implications." </P>

<p>Despite this effort to formalize the street vending industry, over 10,000 people remain on the waiting list for a mobile food vendor license. These applications are distributed amongst the five boroughs, including some applications from Connecticut, New Jersey and upstate New York. Guadalupe, a food vendor who operates in the city without a license says she has been on the waitlist since 2019. She is one of the 431 people living in the Bronx zipcode 10456 waiting for a license. Notably, nearly 60% of the population in this area identifies as Hispanic, reflecting the deep cultural and economic ties of street vending within immigrant communities. Hunter says this new proposition, which can go into effect next year, may drive the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to begin issuing more licenses yearly. </p>
